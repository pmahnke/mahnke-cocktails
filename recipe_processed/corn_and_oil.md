description: "A traditional Barbadian drink from the 1700s, featuring dark rum sweetened and flavored with falernum liqueur."
excerpt: |
  The Corn 'n' Oil is a traditional Barbadian planters' drink which, like the falernum liqueur it is sweetened and flavoured with, dates from the 1700s. Its 'Corn and Oil' name is derived from the <i>Book of Deuteronomy</i>, the fifth book of the Christian Old Testament. Chapters 1–30 are of sermons delivered to the Israelites by Moses on the plains of Moab, shortly before they enter the Promised Land. The salient verse being, "<i>That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.</i>"
