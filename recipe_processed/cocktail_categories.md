excerpt: |
  The world of cocktails comprises numerous different cocktail families, each family having its own surname, distinctive traits, genetics and history. Some of these cocktail families are forgotten and facing extinction while others, such as the Daiquiri, Sour and Colada dynasties, are better known now than when they were first conceived. Follows the 36 families which populate the world of cocktails.<br><br>While not advocating that every cocktail should be pigeonholed under one of the following headings – history/rules should not be allowed to stifle creativity – these cocktail family names do give an indication to the drinker the style of cocktail they are ordering. Consequently, if a cocktail carries one of the following family names, then its ingredients, serving vessel and style should reflect the traits suggested by that name.

### Blazer Cocktails

- Comprises: Spirit + sweetener
- Glass: Snifter
- Serve: Straight-up while still warm
- Created: Mid-1800s by Jerry Thomas

### Buck

- Comprises: Spirit + ginger beer/ginger ale + lime juice

- More info: Bucks originated during the Prohibition era in the form of the Gin Buck. Like the Ricky, the Collins and the Fizz it is a tall drink served with citrus juice and a carbonate. (A Highball is also tall but never contains citrus juice.) Originally a Buck was made by cutting a large lemon into quarters and squeezing the juice of one quarter into the drink using a hand squeezer. The squeezed shell was also dropped into the glass with the juice. Unlike the afore mentioned drinks, no sugar is added to a Buck – sufficient sweetness to balance the lemon is provided by the sweet carbonate.

### Cobbler

- Created: 1600s
- Example: [Eggnog]({%link recipe_processed/eggnog.md%})
- More info: Eggnogs contain sugar, milk (or cream) and the yolk of a fresh egg with either rum, brandy, bourbon or a combination of spirits. Eggnogs are now usually shaken with cubed ice and served straight-up, often with a nutmeg dusting. They are traditionally served at Christmas.

### Fix

- Comprises: Spirit + lemon juice + sugar syrup (mostly raspberry syrup or fresh pineapple &amp; sugar)
- Glass: Old-fashioned or goblet
- Serve: Shaken and served over crushed ice.

### Fizz

- Comprises: Spirit + citrus + sugar + carbonated mixer (soda, ginger ale, champagne)
- Glass: Fizz or Highball (8 to 10oz)
- Serve: Shaken and served in tall chilled glass (without ice) topped with carbonate to produce a thick head.
- Created: Late 1800s
- Example: Ramos Gin Fizz
- More info: Fizzes are based on spirit, citrus fruit juices and sugar, which are shaken with ice and strained into an ice-filled Collins glass, then topped up with something fizzy - soda water, ginger ale or even champagne. The addition of the white of an egg turns a plain fizz into a Silver Fizz; add an egg yolk and it becomes a Golden Fizz; add cream and it becomes a Cream Fizz.
  The Fizz was at its peak popularity in the late 1800s when it was mostly enjoyed as a morning bracer. Where today we are likely to go for a coffee or two to start the day, then it was the Fizz, and as many as six of them. Distinct styles of drink were associated with different occasions/times of day, and whereas the sour was an evening drink, the Fizz was a morning cocktail.

### Flip

- Comprises: Spirit/fortified wine + sugar + egg yolk &amp; white (or just the yolk)
- Glass: Coupe or wine glass
- Serve: Shaken and served up or mixed and heated

- More info: A flip is a cocktail containing egg (the whole egg or just the yolk), sugar and any spirit or fortified wine. Flips are similar to Eggnogs but while Eggnogs contain milk or cream, Flips don't. Flips were originally served hot, often heated with a red-hot poker. Today they are occasionally served hot but more usually cold – shaken with ice and strained into a chilled coupe or wine glass, usually with a nutmeg dusting.

### Frozen

### Grog

- Comprises: Rum + lemon juice + sugar/sweetener

- Created: 1740 or earlier. In 1740, Admiral "Old Grogram" Vernon ordered the British Navy's daily issue of half a pint high-proof rum be replaced with two servings of a quarter of a pint, diluted 4:1 with water which became known as 'grog'.
- Example: Grog
- More info: Any drink made with rum and diluted with water can be called a grog, but grogs usually also contain lemon juice, sugar and aromatic fruits or spices. They can be served hot or cold in a mug or a glass. The name is said to originate from when the British Navy used to issue sailors with a daily ration of rum and water.

### Highball

- Comprises: Spirit + carbonated mixer
- Glass: Highball (max 10oz capacity)
- Serve: Premixed ingredients or simply poured into ice-filled glass.
- Created: 1890s. First known publication by Chris Lawlor of the Burnet House, Cincinnati, USA.
- Example: Scotch Whisky Highball
- More info: Highballs are simple small mixed drinks, most commonly with only two ingredients - a spirit and a carbonate, served in a tall ice-filled glass (often referred to as a Hi-ball glass). Highballs always have a carbonate (tonic, soda etc.) but unlike Rickeys, Collinses and Fizzes, Highballs traditionally do not contain citrus fruit juice, although that last convention no longer applies, and a small amount of juice is acceptable in a Highball. However, a Highball MUST be served in a glass no larger than 10oz or it is no longer a true Highball.

### Julep

- Comprises: Spirit + mint + sugar

### Martini

- Comprises: Gin (or vodka) + vermouth &amp; often bitters

- More info: Martini was (and some would argue still is) a type of cocktail containing gin and vermouth (and optionally orange bitters) served in a stemmed glass, in its heyday usually with a 'V' shaped bowl, commonly referred to as a Martini glass. From the 50s onwards, Martinis were often made with vodka.

### 'Martini'/Alternatini/Neo Martini/Alternatini/Fruit Martini

- Comprises: Vodka (or other spirit) + numerous other ingredients

- Serve: Shaken and served straight-up
- Created: 1990s
- Example: [Espresso Martini]({%link recipe_processed/espresso_martini.md%})
- More info: The bastard child of the cocktail world but thanks to the Espresso Martini, Porn Star Martini and French Martini, arguably the second most successful cocktail dynasty. These 'imposter-' / 'sudo-' / 'Mock-tinis' emerged in the 1990s becoming popular in New York and dominating cocktail menus in London. They grew on the back of the vodka boom, hence tend to be vodka-based. They are predominantly shaken drinks and the only thing they have in common with a true Martini (see above) is they are (or at least were) served in V-shaped Martini glasses but in recent years are more commonly served in coupe glasses.

### Mull

- Comprises: Wine + herbs and spices

The name originates from rum being known as a Grog and the cups it was served in being called Noggins. Hence, egg and nog became Eggnog.

### Posset

- Glass: Two handled Posset
- Serve: Heated over a hob/stove and poured into serving vessel
- Created: 15th century

- Created: Unknown

- More info: Pousse-cafés are very short, layered cocktails, served in a tall Pousse-café glass. Each ingredient must be poured carefully into the glass so that it floats on the previous layer – this is made possible by the different specific weights or densities of different drinks.

Rickeys are served in a highball or sour glass (or an old-fashioned will do) but shorter/smaller than a Collins glass.
