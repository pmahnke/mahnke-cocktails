excerpt: |
  The Right Word is a crisp, floral variation of the classic Last Word cocktail, substituting the herbal intensity of Green Chartreuse and the almond notes of maraschino liqueur for elderflower liqueur and Lillet Blanc. This equal-parts gin cocktail, developed for Fairmont Hotels, offers a bright and refreshing flavor profile with a clean finish.
