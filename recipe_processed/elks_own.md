excerpt: |
  The Elk's Own is a classic cocktail with a rich history dating back to the 19th century. It's a complex and flavorful drink that blends the warmth of rye whiskey with the sweetness of port wine, balanced by tart lemon juice and a touch of sweetness from simple syrup. The addition of egg white creates a smooth, frothy texture.
