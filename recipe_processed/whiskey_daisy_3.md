excerpt: |
  A "Whiskey Daisy No. 3" is a variation of the classic "Daisy" cocktail, which is believed to have originated in the late 1800s, with the earliest known version being a "Brandy Daisy" mentioned in Jerry Thomas's bartending guide; the "Whiskey Daisy" is simply a variation where whiskey is used as the base spirit instead of brandy, and "No. 3" likely refers to a specific recipe variation with slightly different proportions of ingredients within the Daisy family.
