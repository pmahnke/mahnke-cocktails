excerpt: |
  The cocktail was introduced to the public in 1974, devised by the importer of Amaretto di Saronno as a simple mix of two parts amaretto liqueur to one part lemon juice. It became a popular cocktail in the 1980s; most bartenders at the time substituted commercial sour mix for the lemon juice. The drink was popular as a one-dimensional easy-drinking cocktail, flavored mostly by the base spirit used.<br/ ><br />

  Most recipes seen on modern cocktail menus include whipped egg white, bourbon, and lemon juice, to improve on its flavor. Imbibe attributes this change to bartender Jeffrey Morgenthaler, who published a new version of the drink in 2012 using cask-strength bourbon, rich simple syrup, and egg white.
