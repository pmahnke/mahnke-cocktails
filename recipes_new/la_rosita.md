excerpt: |
  The Rosita is a classic cocktail that has been around for decades. It is a tequila-based drink that is similar to a Negroni, but with a few key differences. The Rosita uses equal parts tequila, Campari, and a blend of sweet and dry vermouth. It is typically garnished with an orange twist.
