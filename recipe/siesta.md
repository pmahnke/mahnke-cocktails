description: "A modern classic from 2006, this is a bright and crisp sour similar to a Hemingway Daiquiri, but with tequila and a bitter Campari finish."
excerpt: |
  This cocktail was created in 2006 by Katie Stipe. The build is similar to a Hemingway Daiquiri, but Tequila and Campari steer the drink in a different direction. Itâ€™s bright and crisp with a soft bitterness on the finish that will have you wanting another sip.
