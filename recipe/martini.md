excerpt: |
  The Martini is a classic cocktail known for its elegance and simplicity. It is typically made with gin and vermouth, although vodka is a popular alternative. The drink is stirred with ice and strained into a cocktail glass, often garnished with an olive or a lemon twist.<br /><br />

  The Martini's exact origins are debated, but it is believed to have emerged in the late 19th century. It quickly became a popular drink among the upper classes and has remained a staple of cocktail culture ever since.
