excerpt: |
  The Cupid's cup is a vibrant, refreshing cocktail that balances the punchy, floral notes of Pisco with the bittersweet, citrusy profile of Aperol. It’s a sophisticated twist on a sour, often recognized by its striking bright red or deep pink hue—perfect for Valentine’s Day or any romantic occasion.
