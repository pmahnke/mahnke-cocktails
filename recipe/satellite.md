description: "This is an Anders original which uses gin as its base, and is flavored with falernum and grenadine. It is a riff on the Saturn cocktail."
excerpt: |
  An original creation from Anders Erickson, that puts a fresh spin on the tiki-era Saturn. He trades the heavy almond and passion fruit notes for the spiced-lime sweetness of falernum and a hint of fruity grenadine. A delicate kiss of soda lifts the entire concoction, creating a lighter, brighter orbit of flavors.
