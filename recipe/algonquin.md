description: "A Prohibition-era sour named for the famous Manhattan hotel, featuring rye whiskey and pineapple juice."
excerpt: |
  The drink is believed to have been named after the Algonquin Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, where it was likely first created. The hotel grew famous for many of its patrons, particularly those of the Algonquin Round Table, an informal social club of writers, critics, actors and other cultural luminaries of the era, including Dorothy Parker, Harpo Marx, Blyth Daly, George S. Kaufman, Franklin Pierce Adams, and many others. Ironically, the group peaked during the years marked by Prohibition, of which the Algonquin Hotel’s owner, Frank Case, was a vocal supporter—Case prohibited alcohol service at the hotel in 1917, three years prior to it being outlawed.
