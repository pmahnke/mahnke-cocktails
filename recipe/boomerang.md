excerpt: |
  The Boomerang Cocktail, as recorded by Harry Craddock, is a rich and complex drink notable for its equal-parts combination of rye whisky, blanc vermouth, and Swedish Punsch. Swedish Punsch, a liqueur made with Batavia Arrack, contributes an exotic, spiced-tea sweetness that is central to the cocktail's unique character. A dash of Angostura bitters adds aromatic spice, while a dash of lemon juice brightens the overall flavor profile. This pre-Prohibition style recipe results in a spirit-forward, bittersweet drink that is typically stirred and strained into a cocktail glass. It is a fantastic example of the innovative, complex, and sometimes unusual mixtures popular during the Golden Age of Cocktails.
