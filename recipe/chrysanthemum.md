excerpt: |
  Chrysanthemum appears in Hugo R. Ensslin's 1917 <i>Recipes for Mixed Drinks</i> (and may well have been in his 1916 First Edition).
  <br>
  <blockquote><strong>Chrysanthemum Cocktail</strong>
  <br>- 3 dashes Absinthe
  <br>- ½ Benedictine
  <br>- ½ French Vermouth
  <br>Stir well in a mixing glass with cracked ice, strain and serve with a twist of Orange Peel.
  <br><cite class='alt-font alt-font--natural'>Hugo R. Ensslin, 1917</cite>
  </blockquote>
  It then reappears in Harry Craddock's influential 1930 <i>The Savoy Cocktail Book</i> where Craddock says, "Well-known and very popular in the American Bar of the S.S. Europa.".
  <br>
  <blockquote><strong>Chrysanthemum Cocktail.*</strong>
  <br>- 3 Dashes Absinthe.
  <br>- 1/3 Bénédictine.
  <br>- 2/3 French Vermouth.
  <br>Shake well and strain into cocktail glass.  Squeeze orange peel on top.
  <br>* Well-known and very popular in the American Bar of the S.S. "Europa."
  <br><cite>Harry Craddock, 1930</cite></blockquote>
  This cocktail may be named after <i>The Chrysanthemum</i>, a 1904 piece by the famous ragtime composer and pianist Scott Joplin and released on record in 1916.
