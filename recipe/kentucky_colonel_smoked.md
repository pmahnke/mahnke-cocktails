excerpt: |
  The Kentucky Colonel is a classic cocktail that pays homage to the state's famous bourbon whiskey. It's a simple yet elegant drink that combines bourbon, Benedictine, and Angostura bitters. The Benedictine adds a touch of sweetness and herbal notes, while the bitters balance the flavors.
