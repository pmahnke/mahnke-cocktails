description: "The original and most recognized Voyager cocktail is a rum-based, tiki-style drink created by mixologist Robert Hess. It is relatively dry for a tiki drink and features Bénédictine and falernum liqueurs."
excerpt: |
  The Voyager, created by renowned mixologist Robert Hess in 2006 for the x&quot;Tales of the Cocktail&quot; event in New Orleans, offers a unique spin on the traditional tiki cocktail. It was designed to use less common ingredients like Bénédictine and falernum, which were harder to find at the time, and provides a drier profile while retaining the essential tropical flavors.
