excerpt: 
  Start with one of your favorite rums. A decent white rum is fine, but I prefer a moderately aged, slightly dry spirit, as this adds some intrigue to the end product. Don’t splurge on an expensive, mature bottle; it doesn’t taste that much better, and its oakiness will sometimes quarrel with the spices. My most recent batch was made with a golden rum (80-proof) from St. Vincent. But Cruzan and Mount Gay have both worked well for me in the past.<br><br>Next, take a 750-mL bottle of your rum and pour it into a wide-mouthed, airtight container, like a Mason jar. (You can use the bottle itself, but extracting the orange peel and swollen cinnamon stick when you’re done can be vexing.) Then add a selection of herbs and spices—exactly which and how much are your call—and let it sit. My personal recipe, which is adapted from the inimitable Martin Cate, owner of Smuggler’s Cove in San Francisco, is ready in about two days.<br><br>Making your own spiced rum allows you to tweak the flavor profile—play up the flavors you like by adding more of them, and dial back on those you don’t. Bear in mind that the lower-quality commercial products tend to overplay the vanilla—cut back on that and the other flavors emerge nicely.
