description: "The Savoy's Havana Cocktail is a sweet and complex blend of spirits, featuring gin, apricot brandy, and Swedish Punsch."
excerpt: |
  The original Havana Cocktail from The Savoy Cocktail Book by Harry Craddock is an unusual, spirit-forward recipe that does not include rum or pineapple. It calls for a precise ratio of Gin, Apricot Brandy, and Swedish Punsch, a liqueur historically flavored with arrack. Craddock's instructions specify adding one dash of lemon juice, then shaking well before straining into a cocktail glass. The resulting drink is a complex mix of botanicals, fruit sweetness, and the unique, slightly smoky spice of the Punsch.
