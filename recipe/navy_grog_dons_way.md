excerpt: |
  Don the Beachcomber's Navy Grog is a classic Tiki cocktail created in 1941 by the legendary bartender Donn Beach. It is a powerful drink that typically contains a blend of three rums: dark Jamaican, gold Demerara, and white Cuban or Puerto Rican rum. The rums are mixed with fresh lime juice, white grapefruit juice, and honey syrup. Unlike other famous Tiki drinks, it does not use complex flavored syrups like orgeat or falernum.

  The drink was traditionally served in a double old-fashioned glass with a unique garnish: a cone of shaved ice with a straw running through it. This iconic presentation made the drink a favorite at Don the Beachcomber restaurants and is still a hallmark of the cocktail today. The Navy Grog was so potent that it was often limited to two or three per customer.
