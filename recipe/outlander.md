excerpt: |
  The Outlander, created by Mikki Kristola, is a sophisticated, Scotch-based cocktail that reimagines the classic Old Fashioned structure with an improved, herbaceous profile. It features two ounces of Blended Scotch, lending a smoky and malty foundation, complemented by a half-ounce of sweet, nutty Maraschino Liqueur. A double-dash of aromatic Peychaud's Bitters and a couple of dashes of Absinthe introduce an intriguing layer of anise and spice. Garnish with a lemon twist and a cherry to brighten the rich, warming character of this Varnish original.
