excerpt: |
  The Hot Tiger's Milk is a rich and warming Tiki-era cocktail, first served at Don the Beachcomber, that elevates the classic Hot Buttered Rum profile with tropical ingredients. It is typically built in a mug by combining an aged amber rum with a sweetened batter made from butter, coconut cream, and honey.
