excerpt: |
  The Blended Brandy Alexander captures the essence of the classic cocktail in a frozen dessert. Creamy vanilla ice cream is infused with premium brandy and a touch of chocolate liqueur, creating a smooth, velvety texture. Each bite is rich and indulgent, offering a harmonious blend of sweet, boozy, and chocolate notes.
