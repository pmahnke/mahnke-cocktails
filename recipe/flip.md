excerpt: |
  Flips originally comprised rum or brandy, beer and molasses or sugar, mixed together then heated with a red-hot poker which caramelised the drink and made it bubble and froth. Over time, a tin or copper vessel known as an ale-warmer replaced the poker. Helped by sailors, the Flip crossed the Atlantic where President George Washington became a notable Flip drinker. Here is one of the first complete recipes for a flip from <i>The Cooks Oracle</i>:<blockquote>To make a quart of Flip: Put the Ale on the fire to warm, beat up three or four Eggs with four ounces of moist Sugar, a teaspoon full of grated Nutmeg or Ginger, and a quartern of good old Rum or Brandy.<br>When the Ale is near to boil put it into one pitcher, and the Rum and the Eggs, etc into another; turn it from one pitcher into another until it is smooth as cream.<br><cite>The Cooks Oracle, 1822</cite>
