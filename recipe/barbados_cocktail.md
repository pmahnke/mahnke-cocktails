description: "The Barbados cocktail is a tropical rum drink that balances sweetness with a zesty, bright acidity. Its primary ingredients are dark rum, lime juice, and falernum, a liqueur that imparts a flavor of ginger, clove, and lime."
excerpt: |
  The Barbados cocktail is a rum-forward drink that gets its tropical spice from the addition of falernum. The spirit's boozy sweetness and the falernum's notes of ginger and clove are balanced by freshly squeezed lime juice, creating a bright and complex, yet simple, beverage. The cocktail is considered a spicier, more intricate variation of a classic daiquiri.
