description: "A classic Parisian sour from the 1920s that combines the richness of bourbon and sherry with the tartness of red currant syrup."
excerpt: |
  A voraciously pink Parisian special from the 1920s, this cocktail first appears in print in Harry MacElhone's 1927 <em>Barflies and Cocktails</em>.

  Exactly the same recipe appears three years later in Harry Craddock's 1930 <em>The Savoy Cocktail Book</em>.
