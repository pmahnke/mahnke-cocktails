excerpt: |
  Invented by bartender Doug Petry of Rye in Louisville, Kentucky, this cocktail truly stretches the boundaries of its namesake. While it presents a soft color palette (reddish Peychaud’s bitters floated atop milky white absinthe), the Absinthe Old-Fashioned packs a punch. If you didn’t already have enough reasons to make a pilgrimage to Kentucky and explore its cocktail scene, this one alone is worth the trip.
