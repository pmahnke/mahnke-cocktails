excerpt: |
  Gum syrup (or gomme sirop) is basically simple syrup with the addition of powdered gum arabic. Its main benefit in a drink is added texture. Because it’s thicker, a good amount of weight is added to the drink. It takes a bit more forethought than simple syrup because you have to allow time for the gum arabic to fully incorporate, but the results are nice.<br><br>Typically, gum arabic is added to a rich simple syrup (2:1 sugar:water) so it is sweeter. When a drink calls for a plain simple syrup (1:1). You notice the added texture more so than an increase in sweetness, but it’s still much less thick than gomme syrup.
