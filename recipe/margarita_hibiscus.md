excerpt: |
  The margarita hibiscus cocktail is a refreshing and vibrant drink that combines the classic margarita with the floral notes of hibiscus. It typically includes tequila, orange liqueur, lime juice, and a homemade hibiscus syrup. The syrup adds a beautiful pink hue and a slightly sweet and tangy flavor to the drink.
