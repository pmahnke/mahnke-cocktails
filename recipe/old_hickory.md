excerpt: |
  Named after General Andrew Jackson (before his presidency), this drink pays tribute to his nickname “Old Hickory,” which reflected his tough persona. Surprisingly, this drink is far from tough - it’s light, easy to make, and lower in ABV. The Old Hickory combines both sweet and dry vermouth, making it a smooth, sessionable sipper.
