description: "The Arnaud Martini is a classic cocktail that features gin, dry vermouth, and crème de cassis in equal parts. It is known for its rich burgundy color and an interesting balance of blackcurrant fruitiness and herbal, dry notes."
excerpt: |
  The Arnaud cocktail is a classic, equal-parts drink, initially called the Parisian, and is distinct from the Arnaud's Special (a different cocktail made with Scotch and Dubonnet). Its name, The Arnaud or Arnaud Martini, is associated with the pre-war French actress, singer, and pianist Yvonne Arnaud. The cocktail is made by stirring equal parts gin (often London Dry or a bolder, over-proof gin), dry vermouth, and crème de cassis with ice, and then straining the mixture into a chilled coupe or cocktail glass, sometimes garnished with a blackberry. It offers a slightly sweet palate due to the blackcurrant liqueur, followed by a dry finish from the gin and vermouth, making it a flavorful and often recommended choice as a dessert or after-dinner martini.
