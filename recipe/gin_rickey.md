excerpt: |
	The Gin Rickey is one of the few classic cocktails that doesnâ€™t have an origin muddled by history or shrouded in rumors and innuendo. The invention of this refreshing highball is refreshingly clear: It was named after Joe Rickey, a Democratic lobbyist living in Washington, D.C., during the late 19th century.
