description: "The Just for Mary is a rye whiskey cocktail created by Tony Abou-Ganim, which serves as a variation of the classic Manhattan. It distinguishes itself by swapping sweet vermouth for a combination of Lillet Blanc and a cherry liqueur, resulting in a lighter, more complex, and fruit-forward flavor."
excerpt: |
  Inspired by the Manhattan, the Just for Mary is a rye-forward, spirit-driven cocktail that uses Lillet Blanc and a quality cherry liqueur, such as Cherry Heering. The rye whiskey's spice is balanced by the complex herbal and botanical notes of the Lillet Blanc, while the cherry liqueur adds a rich, fruity sweetness. The resulting drink is a wonderfully layered and sophisticated alternative to the Manhattan, celebrated for its nuanced and rewarding flavor.
