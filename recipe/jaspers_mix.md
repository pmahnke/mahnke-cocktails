  Jasper's Mix is a rum-based cocktail mix that is popular in Jamaica. It is a simple syrup made with lime juice, sugar, Angostura bitters, and nutmeg. It is typically used to make rum punches, but it can also be used to make other cocktails.<br><br>

  The exact origins of Jasper's Mix are unknown, but it is believed to have been created by a bartender named Jasper Le Franc in the 1950s. Le Franc worked at the Bay Roc Hotel in Jamaica, and he is said to have created the mix to serve to guests at the hotel's bar.
