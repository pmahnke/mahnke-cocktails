description: "The Tropical Standard Navy Grog is a modern reinvention of the classic that uses contemporary techniques to refine the flavor. It is a rum-heavy drink that features a spiced grog concentrate syrup made with Mexican cola and toasted allspice, along with acid-adjusted grapefruit juice to perfectly balance the cocktail."
excerpt: |
  The Navy Grog in the Tropical Standard cocktail book by Garret Richard and Ben Schaffer is a departure from the Don the Beachcomber and Trader Vic's recipes, applying modern cocktail techniques to a Tiki classic. The recipe is meticulously crafted, calling for specific measurements of a blend of rums—including a Demerara, a Jamaican, and a white rum—and a complex, homemade "grog concentrate" syrup. This unique concentrate is a key feature, made by toasting allspice and simmering it with Mexican Coca-Cola and sugar. The drink also uses acid-adjusted grapefruit juice, a technique that alters the juice's pH to mimic the brightness and tartness of a different citrus, ensuring a precise flavor balance. The final cocktail is flash-blended and garnished with a spent lime peel and mint.
