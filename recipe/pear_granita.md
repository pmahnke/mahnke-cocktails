excerpt: |
  Pear granita is a refreshing, semi-frozen dessert made by blending pear nectar with Pear liquor and Angosyura Bitters before freezing the mixture into coarse, shaggy ice crystals. Unlike smooth sorbet, this treat features a rustic, "crunchy" texture achieved by periodically scraping the freezing juice with a fork to create a delicate and flaky shaved-ice consistency.
