description: "An old-Fashioned with a splash of rum and port in place of sugar syrup. I favour tawny port, but if you've got a sweet tooth, then use ruby port."
excerpt: |
  Created at New York's old Waldorf-Astoria Hotel (the Empire State Building occupies the site today) for James R Keene, a racehorse owner whose steeds ran in the Suburban Handicap at Brooklyn's Sheepshead Bay track. The Suburban features in Albert Stevens Crockett's 1931 Old Waldorf Bar Days.
