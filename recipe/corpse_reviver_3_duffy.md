excerpt: |
  Patrick Gavin Duffy's 1956 edition of The Official Mixer's Manual describes the Corpse Reviver #3 as a simple highball featuring Pernod, lemon juice, and Champagne. Unlike other Corpse Reviver variations, this version emphasizes the anise flavor of Pernod and functions as a sparkling "pick-me-up" rather than a spirit-forward cocktail.
