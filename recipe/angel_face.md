description: "A classic, spirit-forward cocktail from the Prohibition era that perfectly balances gin, apple brandy, and apricot liqueur."
excerpt: |
  Adapted from a recipe in Harry Craddock's 1930 <i>The Savoy Cocktail Book</i> which stipulates "Shake well and strain into cocktail glass," rather than to stir as modern convention dictates.
