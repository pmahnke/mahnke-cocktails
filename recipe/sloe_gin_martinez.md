excerpt: |
  The Sloe Gin Martinez is a brilliant reconstruction of the Classic Martinez. It was created by London Barman Oskar Kinberg while he ran his own speakeasy style Bar Oskar's Bar in the basement of the now defunct Michelin Star restaurant Dabbous. Not to worry though! If any of you guys find yourself in London you can check out Oskar's work at his second collaboration with Chef Ollie Dabbous, Hide, where he serves as Beverage Director. Kinberg is emerging as one of my favorite bartenders lately. His style is very akin to mine in that his drinks are clean and classically presented but instead of the usual brown or yellow classic style offerings, he uses seasonal ingredients in Farmer's Market drinks. And while this category of drink is usually complex, Kinberg's are simple, perfectly balanced and very satisfying.
