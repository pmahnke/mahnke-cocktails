description: "The Criterion Cocktail is a late-19th-century brandy drink enriched with Bénédictine, bitters, and syrup, giving it a sweet, herbal, and gently spiced profile. Originally published in 1878, it reflects the early era of refined mixed drinks before modern, spirit-forward cocktails took hold."
excerpt: |
  The Criterion Cocktail, first recorded in an 1878 bartending manual, is a brandy-based drink enriched with Bénédictine, bitters, and syrup, giving it a sweet, herbal profile typical of early mixed drinks. Once part of the Victorian-era rise of codified cocktails, it faded from popularity as tastes shifted toward drier, more spirit-forward drinks in the decades that followed.
