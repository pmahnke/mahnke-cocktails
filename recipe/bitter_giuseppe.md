excerpt: |
  This low ABV cocktail is considered a modern classic, and is responsible for numerous variations. It was created by Stephan Cole at the Violet Hour in Chicago. It’s often compared to a Negroni because of its bitter finish, but the build is very different. This is one of the rare instances we'll stir a drink containing citrus! And it's a great pre-dinner drink.
