description: "A refreshing Italian aperitif from the 1860s that builds upon the bittersweet flavor of Campari with sweet vermouth and soda water."
excerpt: |
  The cocktail was first served in creator Gaspare Campari's bar, Caff√® Campari in Milan, in the 1860s, an American man, who was under the impression that Campari was a long drink, ordered it, hated it, and said it would be better served iced and fizzy. He ordered a Campari and soda which became too bitter; after a few iterations he and the esteemed bartender decided on Vermouth as the perfect blend. It is the direct descendant of the "Milano-Torino" which consisted of Campari, the bitter liqueur from Milan (Milano) and Punt e Mes, the vermouth from Turin (Torino) but lacked soda water. This drink was itself a descendant of the "Torino-Milano", a concoction consisting of equal parts Campari and Amaro Cora.
