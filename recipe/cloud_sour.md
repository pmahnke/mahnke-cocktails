description: "A modern sour with a funky, umami-rich character derived from the use of shio koji, a fermented rice marinade."
excerpt: |
  This is a simplified version of a drink we serve at Seed Library, and its freshness makes it a lovely way to welcome the long-overdue arrival of spring. Shio koji is a funky, umami-rich Japanese ingredient made from fermented rice, and is more commonly used in marinades and for seasoning, much as miso and soy sauce are – look for it in specialist food stores and online.
