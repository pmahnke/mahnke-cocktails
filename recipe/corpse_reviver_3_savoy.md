excerpt: |
  The Corpse Reviver #3, a later addition to the series, was created at London's Savoy Hotel around 1948. Unlike its more famous predecessors, the #1 and #2, it is a brandy-based cocktail consisting of equal parts brandy, white crème de menthe, and Fernet-Branca. This stirred drink is a modified Stinger with the addition of Fernet, giving it a distinctive flavor.
